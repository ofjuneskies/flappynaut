# Inspiration
The Flappynaughters, Jennifer and Letsy, were inspired to tackle a space-themed project after finding out that they both loved space. As a matter of fact, VenusHacks's theme was what persuaded them to join the Hackaton. After brainstorming through different project possibilities, the Flappynaughters decided to create a project inspired by FlappyBird, with a space-themed twist. 

# What it does
The gameplay is similar to FlappyBird. The player is an astronaut that floats up and down to avoid planet obstacles. After collecting 5 laptops, the player must fight against the Alien of the Patriarchy, who does nothing but say hurtful, mean, spiteful women stereotypes. It is up to you to put a STOP to his evil antics. 

# How we built it
Through blood, sweat, and tears via PyGame.

# Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we ran into was the objects' hitboxes. The astronaut kept crashing into planets and causing a game over way too early. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The Flappynaughters added more to the game than they originally thought. This includes collectible laptops, a final boss theme, and an inspirational message.

# What we learned
We gained game development experience from PyGame after coming in with no knowledge.

# What's next for Flappynaut
Flappynaught will continue expanding by adding more levels, customization options, multiplayer, and bug fixes.
